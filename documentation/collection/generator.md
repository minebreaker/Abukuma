# Generated classes

Some data models are generated by gradle task `generateDataClasses` to ease development.

All generated classes are:
* Implements `PersistentMap`
* Have a conversion method from `Map`

There are 3 types of models: Record or Map.

## Record type

* It's a map, which is always expected to have defined keys
* Cannot have additional properties
* All non-property modifying operations will return `Map`


## Map-with-additional-properties

* It's a map, which is always expected to have defined keys
* May have additional properties
* All adding operations will return its type `T`, since `T` itself is a map
* All non-property removing operations will return `Map`, since it no longer has 


## Map-view type

* It's just a map, with property accessors, not expected to always have certain properties.
* All modifying operations will return its type `T`, since `T` itself is a map.

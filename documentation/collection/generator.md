# Generated classes

Some data models are generated by gradle task `generateDataClasses` to ease development.

* There are 2 types of models: Record or Map.

## Record type

* It's a map, which are always expected to have same keys
* All (non-property) modifying operations will return `Map`



```yml
package: rip.deadcode.abukuma3.value  # Package
name: SomeRecord                      # Class name
type: record                          # 'record'

import:  # [Optional] Lists of the classes to be imported
  - rip.deadcode.abukuma3.value.*

property:
  - name: value      # Property name
    type: Object     # Type of the property
    optional: false  # Whether property is optional or not
    nullable: false  # Whether property is nullable or not. Ignored if optional is true
    default: false   # Default value for the property
    getter:
      type: String          # 
      implementation: |     # Implementation code
        return "whatever";

method:
  - name: header
    type: Response
    interface: false
    annotation: "@Override"
    argument: Function<Header, Header> header
    implementation: |
      ResponseImpl r = this.copy();
      r.header = header.apply( this.header );
      return r;

code: |  # Additional code fragments
  public static void hello() {
    System.out.println("hello from record");
  }
```


## Map-view type

* It's just a map, with property accessors, not expected to always have certain keys.
* All modifying operations will return its type `T`, since `T` itself is a map.
